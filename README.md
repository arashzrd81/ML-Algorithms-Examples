# ML-Algorithms-Examples
In Machine Learning, there are generally three types of approachess: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In Supervised Learning,
problems are divided into two categories: Regression and Classification. In this repository, I wrote simple examples from both Regression and Classification algorithms,
or in other words, for each algorithm, I loaded a built-in dataset and implemented the corresponding algorithm on it. These algorithms are: Linear Regression, Polynomial
Regression, Multiple Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). I wrote these examples almost
two months after getting acquainted about Machine Learning and at the beginning of spring 2022, and overall it gave me a good view of Machine Learning and its various
algorithms. These examples can be useful for those who just got acquainted with Machine Learning algorithms and I hope you enjoy it.
